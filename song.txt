Do the words still love you?
Can you secure its claim? 
Bottled up like smoke 
Floating over flames 

Babe, so you expect me to endure your pain? 
I can’t wait to, oh forgive me, okay 
I’m gon' bottle it up like smoke 
Can you endure this flame? 

Say «I have no conscience, I’m all about game» 
And I say «That's shallow, and you wont change» 
And those words hurt me in the exchange 
So I splurge and send my tears away 

Do the words still love you 
Can you secure its claim 
Bottled up like smoke 
Floating over flames
